#MEAN STACK

####Container ready to start a brand new mean stack project



first of all, to install dependencies run:
```sh
npm install
```

Then run

```sh 
docker-compose up -d
```

If you visit http://localhost:5050 you can see your project run. 

No need to restart node server because nodemon is installed and restarts node every time you change a file
